<!--
Here are few important notes about tables:
    You can put one table in a cell of other table.
  » The table dimensions are not set initially. They are calculated based
    on the contents of the cells.
  » If the table is given its width in percent or pixels, then the contents
    of the table are adjusted to the specified sizes.
  » Browser doesn't display tables until they are loaded. That's because
    browser needs to calculate table's dimensions, before displaying.
