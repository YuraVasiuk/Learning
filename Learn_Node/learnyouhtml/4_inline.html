        &lt b &gt and &lt strong &gt, as well as &lt i &gt and &lt em &gt produce similar results in browsers. However, they aren't equivalents and interchangeable. &lt b &gt means just <b>bold</b> text, at the same time &lt strong &gt is a tag of logical markup and <strong>highlights</strong> the tagged text. Here again with &lt i &gt which means <i>italic</i> text and &lt em &gt for <em>emotional highlighted</em> words.

        Any number of spaces are displayed as <b>one</b> in the browser. HTML doesn't support hyphenation in words, as text editors do, in other words, <i>all words are written entirely without splitting them</i>. Text takes up the <strong>whole width</strong> of the browser window. If you just write one long line in the HTML code, then in the browser <em>it will be formatted</em>, so that text will fit whole width of the window. If this text is wider than the browser's window, then <em>a horizontal scroll bar would appear</em>.

        Sometimes you need to <span>wrap some text or other elements in a tag</span> which which does not inherently represent anything, for example, for styling purposes. &lt span &gt tag is exactly for this purpose. It is a <span>generic inline container for phrasing content</span>, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes, or because they share attribute values. It should be used only when <span>no other semantic element is appropriate</span>.
