  Besides href, links also have a lot of useful attributes. Here are the
  most important of them:

   » download - this attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead
     of navigating to it.
   » target - specifies where to display the linked URL. It is a name of, or
     keyword for, a browsing context: a tab, window, etc.

  Moreover, you also can put an image inside of link, so you'll get an
  clickable image, like this:

     <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
       <img src="path/to/google-logo.png"
            alt="Google logo" />
     </a>

  It's common to create links that open in the user's email program to allow
  them to send a new message. This is done with a mailto: link. Here's a
  simple example:

     <a href="mailto:email@someone.com">Send email to someone</a>
-->
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Links and References</title>
</head>

<body>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkdvEPfShoA" target="_blank">
       <img src="images/log_house.jpg"
            alt="Log House Videos" />
     </a>
</body>

</html>
