  First of all, we need to start from <form> element which represents a
  document section that contains interactive controls to submit information
  to a web server.

  A <form> element has a lot of attributes, here are the most important of
  them:

   » action - the URI of a program that processes the form information.
   » method - the HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form.
     Possible values are: post — corresponds to the HTTP POST method;get -
     corresponds to the HTTP GET method.
   » name - The name of the form. It must be unique among the forms in a
     document.

  Here is a more information about <form>'s attributes:
  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#Attributes
  )

  Second, knowing what is <form>, you need to know what is <input> — the
  element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in
  order to accept data from the user. How an <input> works varies
  considerably depending on the value of its type attribute.

  Below there is a list of widely used type values:

   » text - a single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed
     from the input value. (default)
   » button - a push button with no default behavior.
   » checkbox - a check box. You must use the value attribute to define the
     value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate
     whether this item is selected.
   » file - a control that lets the user select a file.
   » password - a single-line text field whose value is obscured.
   » radio - a radio button. You must use the value attribute to define the
     value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate
     whether this item is selected by default.
   » submit - a button that submits the form.
